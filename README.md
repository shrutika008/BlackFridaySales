# BlackFridaySales

Welcome to the Black Friday Sales Prediction project! This repository contains the code and resources for predicting sales during the Black Friday shopping season using machine learning techniques.

# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict sales during the Black Friday period based on historical data and various features. We can gain insights into customer behavior and make informed sales and marketing strategy decisions by leveraging data analysis and machine learning algorithms.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains historical data from previous Black Friday sales. It includes various attributes such as customer demographics, product categories, purchase amounts, and more. This dataset provides a rich source of information for training and evaluating the sales prediction model.
